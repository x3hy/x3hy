I'm a low-level developer. I try to write clean, open source, free and optimized software. I love free (*as in freedom*) open source software and community driven projects. Some of my favorite software is made by *suckless software* and *GNU tools*. I value privacy over everything and I despise subscription services. The modern digital world is a mess, having to navigate surveillance, censorship, capitalism, and the ever increasing use of artificial intelligence. Put the power back in the hands of the people. I enjoy minimalism and pretty looking code, and I strive to find simple and compact solutions to advanced problems.

Enough drivel, I have 7 years of linux experience (as of 2025) and I am familiar with most low level systems.
