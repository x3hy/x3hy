I'm a freelance, low-level developer. I usually open source and free software. Of course I love free (*as in freedom*) open source software and community driven projects and some of my favorite software is made by *suckless software* and *GNU tools*. Personally I value privacy over everything and I despise subscription services to the point where I self-host pretty much everything. The modern digital world is a mess, having to navigate surveillance, censorship, capitalism, and the ever increasing use of artificial intelligence. Put the power back in the hands of the people.

Enough drivel, I have 7 years of linux experience (as of 2026) but I am familar with most operating systems. My strongest programming language would be C but I've done work in the likes of x86 ASM, Rust and Python (who hasn't).
