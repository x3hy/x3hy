Welcome to my github profile.

I've done work in C, Python, HTML, CSS and JS. I've done projects covering many computer science topics like algorithms, encryption 
and networking, along with this I have experience in website 
development in vannila languages along with the electron 
framework.

Some tools that I've used along my journey include; VSCode, 
Vi/Vim/NeoVim, Git, Linux, BSD and more.

This is my hobby along with my career in my free time you can 
find me writing C and ASM tools for the command line.
