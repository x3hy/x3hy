I'm a low-level C developer. I write open source, free simple and optimized software. I love free (*as in freedom*) open source software and community driven projects. Some of my favorite software is made by *suckless software* and *GNU tools*. I value privacy over everything, I despise subscription services. The modern digital world is a mess, having to navigate surveillance, censorship, capitalism, and the ever increasing use of artificial intelligence. Put the power back in the hands of the people. I enjoy minimalism and pretty looking code, I strive to find simple and compact solutions to advanced problems.

As mentioned, I specialize in C development, specifically terminal based backends. I've got experience in other more simplisitic languages like Python and Javascript both of which I used mainly for software development. I've been using linux for a while so I'm quite comfortable with scripting in bash and batch (from my time using windows). 

I've become more and more pro misanthropic after seeing the amount of hatred and stupidy imposed onto the world by various forces, If i could move away from society as a whole I would.

Also, I do happen to have 53 repos only a fraction of which are public and even fewer that are activley maintained.. But do not let that deter your opinion of me!!
